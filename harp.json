				"resumo" : "The exhaustion of the capacity of conventional optical systems based on standard single-mode fibers (SSMF) requires new solutions cope with the exponential traffic increase. In this scenario, transmission by few-mode fibers (FMFs) appears as a strong candidate. These systems require adaptive digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms with multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO) at the receiver in order to recover the signals multiplexed signals in the various spatial and polarization modes. However, the proper functioning of these equalizers requires the pre-compensation of the chromatic dispersion (CD) of the receiver using static filters. Since the DSP algorithms in mode-multiplexing systems are of slow convergence, the typical scanning algorithms become difficult to apply. In this work, we investigate the applicability of the algorithm based on the power auto-correlation function to estimate the CD in FMF systems. The results indicate an algorithm vulnerability with the increase of the inter-mode crosstalk level",

After calibrating a simulator with the results obtained experimentally, taken with a roll-off set to 0.1, we varied the roll-off value from 0.1 to 1.0 in the simulation setup and verified its impact on the transmission in a linear regime. The simulated results were, then, combined with data obtained from the literature relating the number of taps of a FIR filter to its energy consumption. Within a given transmitted reach and as long as the system operates within the FEC limit, it is demonstrated that a less stringent specification for the roll-off can lead to a reduction on energy consumption without compromising the system performance. Such a geometric pulse-shaping technique allowed us to establish a 3-D figure of merit based on the resolution of the filter, given by the number of taps, the correspondent roll-off factor and the energy consumption.",

				"titulo" : "Impact analysis of the use of the power mask spectrum information in the adaptive control of optical amplifiers",
				"resumo" : "One of the significant challenges in the dynamic optical networks is the adaptive control of operating point (ACOP) of optical amplifiers. The ACOP approaches aim to autonomously define the gain of the amplifier after changes in the amplifier input power. The ACOP approaches proposed so far use the amplifier power mask to define the gains. The full power mask has information about gain and noise figure for each channel considered in characterization. However, most of these approaches consider a simplified version of the power mask that stores just the worst ripple and worst noise figure among all channels for each operating point. In this paper, we analyze the impact of using the full power mask, instead of the simplified power mask, in one of the first proposed ACOP approaches. We also used the nonlinear interference model in all analyzed cases to evaluate the impact of the non-linear effects for each operating point. The results show that it is possible to achieve results for the compact power mask that are close to the ones obtained from the full power mask for a cascade of amplifiers. These results suggest that the more straightforward approach using the worst ripple and the worst noise figure among all channels for each operating point can present adequate results if small OSNR and ripple penalties are acceptable.",

This study focus in three different dielectric materials for the capacitive structure in the device such as silicon nitride, Si3N4, hafnium oxide, HfO2 and hexagonal boron nitride, hBN. By varying the thickness of the dielectric material, it was possible to improve the extinction ratio, modulation frequency and reduce the switching voltages requirements. By considering a bottom cladding, it was possible to increase the light interaction with the graphene and obtain higher modulation frequencies. In the case of the device with HfO2, it was possible to obtain the highest extinction rate of 0.117 dB/µm with a dielectric thickness of 50 nm. For the model with the hBN thickness layer of 50 nm, the maximum operation frequency was 35 GHz, considering a device length of 27 µm. The condition with the minimum voltage requirements was obtained with HfO2, which the value switching was between 2.5 and 5 V. Although the results with Si3N4 are not the best, it is a good option when the device project try to match all the design requirements.",

				"titulo" : "Invited Paper – Biophotonics and lasers shining light into diseases: IPEN experience",
				"resumo" : "Biophotonics is an exciting interdisciplinary research field, which studies the interaction of photons with biological structures, imaging and sensing cells and tissues. The interaction of light with matter results in reflection, absorption, scattering or transmission of the beam, which can provide information about the molecule or tissue structure. Since 1992 Biophotonics and lasers research at IPEN is providing to the society a wide range of applications from fundamental medical research to diagnosis, therapy and surgery. Prevention of dental caries and dental erosion with lasers: Dental caries is a common oral disease which, viewed simply, is characterized by a demineralization of the dental hard tissue caused by acids generated in the oral biofilm. Although a remarkable decline in the incidence of dental caries worldwide has been documented, it is still the most prevalent disease during childhood and adolescence. On account of the widespread use of fluoride, lasers have been tested to improve dental enamel properties in order to enhance its resistance to demineralization. We evaluated the effect of combining laser irradiation (Nd:YAG and Er,Cr:YSGG) with fluoride on an enamel microstructure and demineralization by FTRaman and FTIR Spectroscopy. Demineralization promoted reduction in organic contents; Nd:YAG laser irradiation promoted loss of carbonate and organic content, while Er,Cr:YSGG did not produce significant changes in the relative band intensities of organic and inorganic contents of the enamel. In lased samples, almost no effects caused by pH-cycling on enamel were observed. Our group showed that laser treatment and its association with fluoride can interfere with the demineralization dynamics, reducing its effects over the enamel. X-Ray diffraction at Synchrotron source provided information on the crystalline changes in the hydroxyapatite and new phase formed after laser irradiation, elucidation the physical reasons for the treatment success. A clinical trial with 100 children irradiated with Nd:YAG laser in combination with professional fluoride application, demonstrated that after 1 year , the lesion incidence (any amount of demineralization) in the laser treated group was ~ 39% lower when compared with children fluoride treated only. Diagnosis of skin cancer: Nonmelanoma skin cancers represent 95% of cutaneous neoplasms. Among them, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the more aggressive form and shows a pattern of possible metastatic profile. 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its methylated ester (MAL) are the most common topical agents used in photodynamic therapy (PDT) as precursors of the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). The induction of newly PpIX depends on incubation time of each photosensitizer in the tissue and the presence of high intralesional porphyrin levels is an important parameter for the PDT effectiveness. We used laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy to evaluate the optimum time to light exposure of PDT mediated by ALA (20% w/w) and MAL (10% w/w) to treat malignant lesions precursors of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma induced in mice. The therapeutic effects obtained by optimized ALA- and MAL-PDT were assessed 10 and 20 days after treatments. Higher PpIX levels were evidenced in the lesions photosensitized by ALA than MAL and according to LIF measurements the PDT irradiation was performed, respectively, at 300 and 330 minutes after ALA and MAL incubation. Histopathological analysis evidenced necrosis and epithelial atrophy after 10 days of PDT using both prodrugs, as well as reepitelization and collagen deposition at 20 days. Thus, despite the distinct concentration of ALA and MAL used in the formulation of each photosensitizing cream, PDT mediated by both photosensitizing agents obtained similar therapeutic outcomes. Besides, we used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy to assess the biochemical changes in normal skin caused by squamous cell carcinoma induced by multi-stage chemical carcinogenesis in mice. Changes in the absorption intensities and shifts were observed in the vibrational modes associated to proteins, indicating changes in secondary conformation in the neoplastic tissue. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to evaluate the potential of the technique to differentiate the spectra of neoplastic and normal skin tissue, so that the accuracy obtained for this classification was 86.4%, while multivariate analysis of the spectra second derivative had 95,7%. Photodynamic therapy of skin cancer: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become a promising alternative for treatment of skin lesions such as squamous cell carcinoma. We propose a non-invasive method to monitor the effects of PDT by using the optical attenuation coefficient (OAC) calculated from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. We conducted a study on mice with chemically induced neoplastic lesions and performed PDT on these lesions using local developed photosensitizers cream (PI 0705591-9). The response of neoplastic lesions to therapy was monitored using, at the same time, macroscopic clinical visualization, histopathological analysis, OCT imaging, and OCT-based attenuation coefficient measurement. Results with all four modalities demonstrated a positive response to treatment. The attenuation coefficient was found to be 1.4 higher in skin lesions than in healthy tissue and it decreased after therapy, demonstrating that the OAC is a potential tool to noninvasively assess the evolution of skin neoplastic lesions with time after treatment. Other examples will be discussed, such as Femtosencond laser as coadjutant treatment of burned skin, Optical Coherence Tomography monitoring head and neck vascular malformations and hemangiomas, Infrared Thermography determining safety laser irradiation conditions in Dentistry, Lasers in bone regeneration, etc. Acknowledgements This study was supported by CEPID/FAPESP 05/51689-2, CAPES/PROCAD 88881.068505/2014-01, CNPq/INCT 465763/2014-6 and PQ 309902/2017-7.",

The combination of spectroscopy and microscopy technologies enable wide-field scanning of a sample, providing a hyperspectral image with tens of thousands of spectra in a few minutes. In order to increase the information content of FTIR images, different clustering algorithms have been proposed as segmentation methods. However, systematic comparative tests of these techniques are still missing. Thus, the present paper aims to compare the ability of K-means Cluster Analysis (KMCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) as clustering algorithms to reconstruct FTIR hyperspectral images. Spectra for cluster analysis were acquired from healthy cutaneous tissue and the pseudo-color reconstructed images were compared to standard histopathology in order to assess the number of clusters required by both methods to correctly identify the morphological skin components (stratum corneum, epithelium, dermis and hypodermis).",

We use the Concurrence as a measure of entanglement between the two systems and compare it to the Roughness of the system, which indicates the degree of classicality of a given quantum state. Although the Concurrence values are not directly related with the Roughness of each subsystem alone, we found evidence of correlation between the two functions when considering a generalized sum of Roughness over the two subsystems, whereas the minimum of one of them occurs for the maximum of the other. Based on the behaviour of the two functions, we use them to propose a new Quantum Resource Quantifier.",

The finer granularity of all optical OFDM-based bandwidth allocation is more efficient than the networks based on wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). However, the routing is more difficult because of the spectrum assignment. Then the problem is known as the routing and spectrum assignment (RSA). To solve the RSA, we propose a heuristic algorithm to minimize the maximum load and balance the traffic load over the network while minimizing the number of hops between a source-destination pair. We compare the proposed algorithm with the simpler shortest path allocation algorithm in an incremental traffic simulation, then we do a study of the traffic blocking characteristics of the routing algorithms while the traffic is incremented to the point of saturating or capacity of the network. The results show that the proposed heuristic algorithm can indeed minimize the maximum load on the network, balance the traffic among all links and save resources for future requests. Furthermore, the analysis of the blocking characteristics show that the proposed heuristic can postpone traffic blocking, in some circumstances.",

Hybrid solutions, including the optical packet switching (OPS) paradigm have been proposed in optical networks designed for specific applications, for instance data center optical networks, and offers a better efficiency in the resource usage. Therefore, to allow future studies we present an adaptation of Optical Network Simulator (ONSim) to work on hybrid switching paradigms.

				"resumo" : "In Elastic Optical Networks (EON), the problem of routing and spectrum Allocation (RSA) has been solved along the years through the use of optimization techniques or heuristics, with the aim of minimizing the use of network resources or maximizing the capacity for future requests. The effects of the physical layer in the RSA problem are of fundamental importance given that there is a distance limitation with the required bit rate and modulation format used to transmit the signal. On considering the linear and non-linear noise effects, it is possible to include quality of transmission (QoT) in the optimization process. In this paper, we propose a modification to a traditional heuristic for the RSA problem in Elastic Optical networks to consider both effects of the physical layer. The proposed modification takes into account the channel input power and SNR Margin to choose all modulation formats and to assign resources. The main goal is to increase the spectral efficiency and throughput of the channels by mitigating blockages in the physical layer. Simulations were performed for various topologies, and the results suggest advantages in terms of number of blocked channels and spectrum usage of the new proposal in relation to the traditional BSR heuristics.",

In CMOS-compatible photonic array antennas, fabrication constraints, however, limit the minimum separation distance between radiation element to several wavelengths, which results in the presence of strong side-lobes known as grating lobes. These grating lobes represent a critical impairment that prevents the adoption of these sparse array antennas in applications where crosstalk and security faults must be avoided. In this work, we numerically analyze the side-lobe level (SLL) reduction of 1D sparse antenna arrays under beam steering operation when the radiating elements are arranged non-uniformly (the separation between radiation elements is increased geometrically). The proposed method has a single parameter and, therefore, can be easily optimized. Furthermore, the approach may be extended to higher dimensions. Preliminary results reveal a worst-case side-lobe level reduction of approximately 5~dB for a 5-element array with a total length of 6 wavelengths.",

The acquired and post-processed data encompass the SOA operating under practical conditions, ranging its bias current, switching technique, and optical link. The implemented feed-forward filtering method was based on the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm, aiming to evaluate its capacity to adapt to the SOA operational conditions, mitigating both the nonlinear SOA dynamic behavior and signal-to-noise degradation. The results showed a strong dependency on the quantity of symbols per switching cycle and the possibility to achieve a modest improvement in the system overall bit error rate, specially due to noise degradation mitigation. Considering the small computational power requirement of this approach, its application could be a possible solution to improve the commutation rates of networks that already include post-processing stages.",

We show all processes to which a silicon substrate is subjected up to the moment of obtaining a final device, as well as the characterization of these guides. With the pedestal technology, it is possible to use novel materials that are highly inert to chemical etchants or alloys composed of heavy metal elements since that this technique does not require etching of the core material itself. Lateral confinement of the light bean in pedestal technology is performed through the fabrication of pedestal by Reactive Ion Etching on the lower cladding. In this case, the last step is the deposition of the core layer and the etching of this layer is no longer necessary. In addition, the ability to explore nonlinear light interaction with different materials, which have been explored very little due to fabrication process difficulties, are of great interest, since these materials have different optical properties, which could be leveraged to achieve better dispersion engineering than that obtained with current state of the art materials such as silicon and silicon nitride, for example. As mentioned, this is mainly possible due to the fact that the etching for the definition of the sidewalls is done before the deposition of the core layer and not after, which means it is not necessary to perform an etching process in the core of the waveguide. In the present work we present the fabrication of pedestal based-optical waveguides using Aluminum Nitride and Titanium oxynitride films as core layer due to the fact that these materials present a great interest for the fabrication of Nonlinear Optics integrated devices.",

The central frequency of the divider is 7.4THz, the biasing DC magnetic field is 0.6 T. We present also the characteristics of the three-way divider.
