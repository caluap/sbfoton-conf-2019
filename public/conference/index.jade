      h2 SBFoton Conference 2018
      p The recently founded Brazilian Photonics Society, SBFoton, proudly invites the optics and photonics community to its first annual meeting, the SBFoton International Optics and Photonics Conference, to be held from October 8-10 in Águas de Lindoia, a resort destination famous for its water springs and rural tourism, located not far from the city of Campinas in the State of São Paulo.
      p It is the first specific conference for Photonics and related technologies in Brazil. It ranges from optical communication systems and devices; industrial applications (lasers, optics, coatings), biophotonics (biomedical and biophysics); optical sensors and sensing systems; automotive, aviation and agricultural applications; optoelectronic materials and devices; nanophotonics and plasmonics, integrated photonics, to color and science vision; and related areas. 
      p The forum is an excellent opportunity for scientists, professors, students, engineers, industry managers and technical leaders to come together and share their expertise, discoveries, and excitement in the most fast-growing and impacting areas of human technical development. It is expected that the high-quality science and comprehensive programming should make SBFoton´2018 the very best opportunity for discussing present and future trends of this exciting branch of science, technology and innovation. 
      h2 Call for Papers
      p Prospective authors are encouraged to submit a full paper for review. Only original papers that have not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere should be considered. Paper submission deadline is May 28th.

Therefore, please register and upload your paper from March 27th to May 28th using the EDAS system. In case you do not have an EDAS account yet, follow the instruction to create one at the EDAS website: #[a(href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2007/newPerson.php@noauth=1&.html", target="_blank") #{"http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2007/newPerson.php@noauth=1&.html"}]. 
      p Using your EDAS’s account, log in and choose “SBFoton 2018”. At least one of the authors of each paper must have a full registration for attending the conference;  one full registration refers to at most two papers in the registration form. The acceptance notification of the papers submitted to “SBFoton 2018” will be sent to the main author on August 3rd. After acceptance, authors will be asked to address the reviewers' comments and submit a final version of the paper.
      p The final version should address possible comments and recommendations from the reviewers and it MUST include the copyright notice to the bottom (in the footer, on the left side) of the first page of each paper.
      p The authors of accepted papers to “SBFoton 2018” should upload the final version by August 27th, 2018. The upload of a new IEEE pdf express compatible file is mandatory, and it must be done in EDAS.

      h2 About the Brazilian Photonics Society (SBFoton)
      p The Brazilian Photonics Society has begun its activities on May 24th, 2017 with the main objective to work for increasing the importance and awareness of optics and photonics in Brazil and South America. 
      p Today, in Brazil, the research groups require an organization that collects and provides information, training and professional connectivity across a broad area of common interest in optics and photonics. Companies, research centers, and academia will benefit from this interaction and shared knowledge. Come and join us in this initiative!
      p To contact SBFoton and take active part in this movement, send an email to #[a(href="mailto:sbfoton@sbfoton.org.br") sbfoton@sbfoton.org.br].
