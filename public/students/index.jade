        h3 Selection Process
        p #[strong The competition extends equally to papers presented in oral session and poster session]. Therefore the evaluation criteria will be set according to the type of presentation and, then, normalized to a common pattern. The competition will be evaluated by a jury of experts in the oral/poster presentation, during the designated Technical Session. Together with the online data entry system, the submissions will be evaluated for:

        ul.buleted
          li Quality of work
          li Novelty of approach
          li Significance of the contribution to the field of SBFoton
          li Clarity of presentation (either oral or poster)
          li Visual presentation (either oral or poster)

        p For the final score computation, the score received from reviewers during the review process (EDAS), prior to the conference, will be also taken into account.
