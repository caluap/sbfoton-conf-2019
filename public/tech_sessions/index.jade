      //- h3.h-caps Guidelines
      //- .separador-1-half
      //- p The poster should be a visual presentation of your submitted paper and should meet the following criteria:
      //- ul.buleted.duas-colunas
      //-   li #[strong TITLE] The title should be the same as in the submitted paper. Characters should be a minimum of 48 point font size. Your name, School or Center should also be displayed on the poster.
      //-   li #[strong SIZE] The poster must be no less than A1 and no larger than A0 size (AO size is 841mm × 1189mm). Orientation of your poster must be in portrait style.
      //-   li #[strong LETTERING] The poster should be easily readable at a distance of two metres. Use UPPER and lower case for general content as the use of all-capital text is difficult to read. Avoid using a mixture of type/font styles.
      //-   li #[strong HEADINGS] 48 to 60 point font size is recommended for headings.
      //-   li #[strong CONTENT] 24 to 32 font size single spaced is recommended. The text should be concise and easy to read.

      //- p The message that your poster contains should be clear and understandable without the requirement of oral explanation. If relevant, methods should be presented simply and concisely.
      //- p After the title, the two most important panels are the Introduction and the Conclusion. On the basis of these two panels, a reader will decide whether to consider the poster details and perhaps talk to the presenter. These panels need to be very simple, concise and visually attractive.
      //- p Results should be presented graphically if possible. Avoid large tables of data. Results should be in line with those originally submitted in your paper.
      //- p Use pictures, symbols and colour. Figure legends are essential and should be short but informative. If using graphs, they should have a short heading. For visual effect, we recommend that graphs be no smaller than 12cm × 18cm.
      //- p Photographs should be no smaller than 12cm × 18cm.
      //- p Use the space to attract your audience for discussion, not to present complex details of methods and results.
